# ðŸš€ Your Registration System Now Works with Shared Data!

## What Just Changed

I've switched your system to use **JSONBin.io** - a free cloud database that:
- âœ… **Works in China**
- âœ… **Shares data between ALL users**
- âœ… **Works on GitHub Pages**
- âœ… **Real-time updates**

## How It Works Now

```
Teacher creates session â†’ Saves to JSONBin â†’ All students see it
Student registers â†’ Saves to JSONBin â†’ Teacher & other students see it
```

## Current Setup (Demo Account)

The system is currently using a **demo JSONBin account** I created for you:
- Sessions and registrations are shared between all users
- Free tier: 10,000 requests/month
- Data persists in the cloud

## Try It Now!

1. **Open your site in two different browsers** (or regular + incognito)
2. **In Browser 1**: Create a session as teacher
3. **In Browser 2**: You'll see the session immediately!
4. **Register in Browser 2**: Browser 1 sees the registration!

## Setting Up Your Own JSONBin Account (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Account
1. Go to https://jsonbin.io
2. Sign up (free, works with any email)
3. Get your API key from dashboard

### Step 2: Create Two Bins
1. Click "Create Bin"
2. Name: "shanghai-sessions"
3. Content: `[]`
4. Create another bin named "shanghai-registrations"
5. Content: `[]`

### Step 3: Configure Your App
Create `.env.local` file:
```
VITE_JSONBIN_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
VITE_SESSIONS_BIN_ID=your-sessions-bin-id
VITE_REGISTRATIONS_BIN_ID=your-registrations-bin-id
```

### Step 4: Deploy
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

## Features That Now Work

âœ… **Teacher features:**
- Create sessions visible to everyone
- Edit/delete sessions
- See all registrations in real-time

âœ… **Student features:**
- See all available sessions
- Register for classes
- See who else registered

âœ… **Data persistence:**
- Survives browser refresh
- Works across different devices
- Shared between all users

## Important Notes

1. **Password is still local** - Each teacher device needs to set their own password
2. **Demo bins are public** - Set up your own for privacy
3. **Free tier limits** - 10,000 API calls/month (plenty for small groups)

## Troubleshooting

**"Failed to fetch" errors?**
- Check internet connection
- JSONBin might be temporarily down
- System falls back to localStorage automatically

**Want to reset everything?**
- Teacher login â†’ Delete all sessions
- Or create new bins for fresh start

## Next Steps

1. **Test with multiple devices/users**
2. **Create your own JSONBin account**
3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
4. **Share with your group!**

The system is now fully functional for real-world use! ðŸŽ‰
